                  The idea of Docker before this week has always been one that's more foreign to me. I had always associated it with the idea of containerization, but never realized the usefulness of being able to just pull down an already configured and working environment with all my relevant tooling and needed dependencies ready to go.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It took a little while to comprehend, but after doing some personal experimentation on my own with mounting physical volumes to virtual Docker space, was my biggest a-ha moment this week. When learning about it in class, honestly I was very confused. It took a good bit of searching on Youtube and Google to understand all that was happening and how it worked, but now that I do I see the usefulness of it through and through. I found a lot of use in a video by "Ethereum-Blockchain-Developer | BlockOnAir", <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0pzuymRloo">linked here</a>. It's only 10 minutes, but definitely a very worthwhile watch.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Moving on, to Collatz optimizations. When dealing with large problems, I've realized that I tend to focus heavily on the bigger picture. This week's lectures were a great reminder that sometimes smaller optimizations can lead to massive improvements in efficiency through and through. Pairing this with optimizations previously mentioned in passing, and doing more research about the subject, my current working solution is far more advanced than the ones that I attempted while first attempting the Problem on Kattis as well as working on the assignment. I completely forgot how useful it is to know some quick math skills and their relation to binary manipulation, and this was a great reminder to that skill.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  My tip of the week is something from the folks over at <a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/">Google Deepmind: Genie 3</a>. They describe it as "A new frontier for world models" capable of creating entire three dimensional game spaces based on a single prompt, combing hyper realism and animation together in ways that are rarely seen outside of Hollywood levels of production. I spent some time on the website over the last couple of days after hearing about it from my roommate, and it's safe to say, I'm shocked.
